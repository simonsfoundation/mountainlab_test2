Note: the documentation / installation instructions are out-dated and in progress. So please contact me (Jeremy) for help getting started. You may also be able to help us create the docs.

MountainSort is spike sorting software developed by Jeremy Magland, Alex Barnett, and Leslie Greengard at the Simons Center for Data Analysis in close collaboration with Jason Chung and Loren Frank at UCSF department of Physiology. It is part of MountainLab, a general framework for data analysis and visualization. MountainLab is being developed by Jeremy Magland, Alex Barnett, Witold Wysota, and Sebastian Baginski.

The software comprises tools for processing electrophysiological recordings and for visualizing and validating the results.
